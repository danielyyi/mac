Check out the game here: https://ysun.itch.io/mac

mac is a minimalist, 'run and gun' type FPS shooter made Unity. The goal is to speed through the obstacle course, destroying all 15 randomly spawned in targets, all while getting the fastest time possible. 

I needed to implement player movement, player camera movement, a gun script (with reloading, scoping, motion sway, animations, ammo counter, etc.), speed and target counters, saving system for player highscores, obstacles, SFX and Music, and UI controlling sensitivity and volume. 

This is the first finsihed game I've posted to Itch.io. Ive experimented with other projects in the past however I havent gotten them to a finished state yet.
